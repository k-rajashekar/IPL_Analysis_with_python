# IPL 2022 Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing IPL 2022 data using Pandas, Plotly Express, and Plotly Graph Objects. 
The code performs various tasks to gain insights into team performances, player statistics, and match dynamics in IPL 2022.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Plotly Express
- Plotly Graph Objects
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

## Code Explanation
- The code reads the IPL 2022 data from a CSV file using Pandas.
- It creates bar graphs to display the number of matches won by each team, top scorers, and best bowlers.
- Pie charts visualize the distribution of match results and toss decisions.
- Additional bar graphs showcase the runs scored by top scorers and the number of "Player of the Match" awards.
- A grouped bar chart compares the number of wickets falling in the first and second innings across different venues.
